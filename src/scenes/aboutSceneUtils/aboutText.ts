export const playText = `You can create a game by clicking on the icon of the faction you want to play as. Matchmaking happens automatically: if there is already a game looking for players, you will be paired immediately. If not, you will see your game under the "Looking for games" section.

Games in the game list are organized on sections based on their status. Here's the order in which they appear in the game list:

-Your turn: You should probably click on these and play your turn.

-Challenges received: Click on these games to select a faction and start playing against the player who challenged you. You can also decline by clicking the X button on the top-right corner of the game.

-Opponent's turn. Your opponent should probably click on those and play their turn.

-Searching for players: As mentioned earlier, these are open games created by you. When another player looks for a game they will be paired with you. If you don't want to search for a game anymore, you can click the X button on the top-right corner of the game to delete it.

-Challenges sent: These games are waiting for the player you challenged to pick a faction or decline the challenge. You can remove the challenge by, you guessed it, clicking on the X button on the top-right corner of the game.

-Finished: Here you will find your 5 more recent finished games. You can click on a game to see the final game state and challenge your opponent to a rematch.

Please note that one ore more of these categories may not be present in your game if you don't have any games that qualify. E.g., you won't see a "Challenges sent" category if you have not sent any challenges.

You can come back to the main menu by clicking on the "Home" button.`;

-Email preferences: The game sends an email when it's your turn to play, when a game ends and when you receive a challenge. If you don't wish to receive emails, leave the checkbox blank. Note: An email confirmation email was sent to you when you created the account. If you have not confirmed your email, you will not receive email notifications, even if the checkbox is ticked.

-Enable chat: Having this option checked allows people to message you in the in-game chat. Or it will, once I add an in-game chat to the game.

-Delete account: Clicking on this button will open a confirmation popup. Deleting your account is irreversible, I have no way to recover your data.`;

export const mechanicsText = `Basic:

    • 5 action points (AP) per turn (3 AP for the first player on their first turn to balance first player advantage).

    • 1 AP can be used to:
    	- deploy a unit to deploy square
    	- move a unit
    	- attack an enemy unit or crystal
    	- heal or revive a friendly unit
    	- use a unit special ability
    	- equip a unit with an upgrade
    	- use a one-time item
    	- return a unit or item from your hand back into the deck (the door icon) to draw a random one next turn

    • A unit that reaches 0 HP is knocked out, but can be revived by an ally. It vanishes from the board permanently if:
    	- any player moves a unit onto it (“stomps” it)
    	- destroys it with certain spells
    	- its owner takes a full turn without reviving it

    • A player loses upon having all of his crystals destroyed, or by having all of the units in his deck stomped or knocked out (the game will end even if he has an item left that can revive a KO'd unit).

    • Units are drawn in random order throughout the game, except that your starting hand always has at least 3 units.

Map features:

    • Crystals. There are two per faction, each one with 4500 hp. Destroy both of your opponent's crystals to win the game.

    • Deploy square. Enemy units cannot move onto it, even to stomp. An enemy unit adjacent to a deploy square can attack a corpse that's on the square (which destroys it), without moving onto it. A Necromancer or Inferno can also destroy a KO'd unit on a deploy square.

    • Attack square (red sword). A unit on the square has +100 attack power, applied before all %-based bonuses.

    • Defense square (blue shield). A unit on the square has +20% physical resist.

    • Magic Defense square (dark blue helm). A unit on the square has +20% magical resist.

    • Assault square (purple gem). While a friendly unit is standing on this square, all attacks against enemy crystals do an extra 300 damage. Multiple assault bonuses stack. The bonus is reduced accordingly if the crystal takes AoE or chain damage. The bonus damage has no type and is not affected by any resist.

    • Teleport square (light blue dot). A unit on the square can use 1 AP to teleport to the other teleport square, if it is open.

Advanced:

    • Range is counted orthogonally only, not diagonally (e.g. a unit one square diagonally from another is at range 2).

    • Each unit has an attack power, and a damage type (physical or magical). • Ordinary attacks hit for damage equal to the unit's attack power, but some multiply by certain percentage or add other bonuses. The attack power is what's shown in the unit's info window.

    • Each target also has a physical and magical resist, which reduce incoming damage of the appropriate type by a fixed percentage.

    • Ranged attacks (but not ranged friendly actions) require line of sight to the target. Enemy units and crystals block line of sight, but friendly ones do not. An attack to an immediately diagonal square can't be blocked.

    • A unit that can act on a corpse (healer reviving a friendly corpse, or Necromancer/Wraith destroying an enemy one) can't choose to move and stomp the corpse instead. Clicking on the corpse causes the unit to act on it. However, if the unit does not have line of sight to the enemy corpse, it will move and stomp instead.

    • Knockbacks only occur if the target square is open, otherwise the unit simply doesn't move. If a unit is KO'd by the knockback, it still moves. A unit can't be knocked onto an enemy start tile, unless it's also KO'd (in which case an enemy spawning there will stomp it).

    • A unit can wind up on an enemy deploy square if it's KO'd onto it and then revived, or if it's a Wraith that spawned from a corpse on that square. It will block the enemy from deploying units there so long as it remains.
    • A corpse on its own deploy square will be stomped automatically if a friendly unit deploys there.

    • Units cannot target themselves with heals or other buffs.`;
