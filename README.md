Fan Academy is a fan-made revival of the game **Hero Academy**, a turn-based tactics game developed by Robot Entertainment. This project aims to bring back the joy of the original game, offering a way for fans to rediscover it.

This is not a reverse engineering of the game. The game logic is being implemented from scratch while using the original assets to try to preserve the game's aesthetic as much as possible.

## What is Hero Academy?

Hero Academy is a player-versus-player turn-based tactics game where players choose a team of heroes and use their units and items to defeat their opponents. Unfortunately, the game is currently deadf, delisted from all stores and its online servers shut down. It is no longer possible for people who purchased the game to play it.

Learn more about the original game [here on its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_Academy).

## How was Fan Academy made?

Fan Academy is written in Typescript, using the game engine [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for the client and Node, Express,. MongoDB and [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/) for the back-end.

The server code is hosted on a [separate repository](https://github.com/Dan-DH/fan-academy-be).
