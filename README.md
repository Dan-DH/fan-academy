Fan Academy is a fan-made revival of the game **Hero Academy**, a turn-based tactics game developed by Robot Entertainment. This project aims to bring back the joy of the original game, offering a way for fans to rediscover it.

This is not a reverse engineering of the game. The game logic is being implemented from scratch while using the original assets to try to preserve the game's aesthetic as much as possible.

**The game is currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT**, with the intention to be made available via itch.io once ready.

## What is Hero Academy?

Hero Academy is a player-versus-player turn-based tactics game where players choose a team of heroes and use their units and items to defeat their opponents. Unfortunately, the game was delisted from all stores and its online servers shut down, making it impossible to play as intended.

This project attempts to bring it back to life, allowing fans to continue enjoying the game in some form.

Learn more about the original game [here on its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_Academy).

## Why create Fan Academy?

I loved playing Hero Academy back in the day, and no other mobile game has come close to replicating the fun I had with it. Although the game still runs on Steam, the servers were shut down years ago, making it unplayable in its original form. I decided to bring it back as a fan project to allow people who bought the game to continue playing it, and for new people to discover it.

The name **Fan Academy** highlights that this is a fan project, with no commercial intent, just a passion to preserve and share a great game.

## How was Fan Academy made?

Fan Academy is written in Typescript, and is being developed using the game engine [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) for the client and Node, Express and [Colyseus](https://colyseus.io/) for the back-end.

The server code is hosted on a [separate repository](https://github.com/Dan-DH/fan-academy-be).
